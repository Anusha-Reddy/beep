  "plot_outline": "The year is 1985 and Marty McFly is your everyday teenager, except for one problem. He is stuck in 1955. After his good friend Doc Emmett Brown is gunned down, Marty ends up sending the DeLorean back thirty years into the past. Now, he must find the Doc and convince him that he is from the future, in order for the Doc to send him back to the future, but this is the least of Marty's problem. After accidentally getting in the way of the important meeting between his future mother and father, Marty must get them back together before he changes time forever, and destroys his own existence.  Written by simon\n\nIn the life of Marty McFly, all is not well. His family is dysfunctional, his school punctuality is questionable and the music he likes and plays is just too darn loud. His one true light is his girlfriend Jenny and his one true friend is the somewhat off-kilter Doctor Emmett Brown. In a request from Doctor Brown, Marty meets the mad scientist and discovers that his friend has built a time machine out of a DeLorean. From there, Marty's humdrum life becomes literally a blast from the past as he is transported to 1955. A stranger in a strange yet familiar land, Marty must seek out Doctor Brown to help send him back to his own time while simultaneously ensuring that his parents meet and fall in love. Written by Vampire Sharpshooter\n\nMarty McFly helps out his friend Doc Brown, and ends up being taken back in time by Doc's time-machine. Marty, a boy of the 80's, has to come to grips with being in the 50's and get his parents to fall in love to set straight the damage his presence has done to the events of the past. Written by Greg Bole {bole@life.bio.sunysb.edu}\n\nMarty McFly, a typical American teenager of the Eighties, is accidentally sent back to 1955 in a plutonium-powered DeLorean \"time machine\" invented by slightly mad scientist. During his often hysterical, always amazing trip back in time, Marty must make certain his teenage parents-to-be meet and fall in love -- so he can get back to the future. Written by Robert Lynch {docrlynch@yahoo.com}\n\nMarty McFly is an aspiring musician, but he is not sure of what the future holds for him; first his band was rejected as the performing band for the school dance, and historically, no McFly has succeeded in anything. The only bright spots in his existence are his girlfriend and Emmett Brown, the town crackpot scientist, who is Marty's good friend. Marty was helping brown with his latest invention a time machine, which is fitted into a Delorean. The time machine needs a tremendous amount of power to work, which he gets from plutonium. Now Brown got the plutonium from some Libyans who want him to build a bomb; they find Brown and shoot him, Marty gets into the Delorean and drives off and when he reaches the speed of 88 mph that activates the time machine, he finds himself in 1955, cause that was the date that Brown entered, which was when he first conceived the time machine. Now having already used up all the power of the plutonium, Marty must find a way to get it working, so he can go back to his own time. Marty looks for Brown but before he does, he runs into his father as a teenager, and accidentally interferes with his father's first meeting of Lorraine, his future mother. Marty then goes to see Brown and convinces him that he is from the future and to help him. But when he learns of the amount of power that is needed to power the machine, he tells Marty that it's hopeless cause the only other thing that can generate that much power is a bolt of lightning and it's impossible to determine when and where they will strike, but Marty has with him an old newspaper cliping that states that the town clock tower will be struck by lightning, so they plan to draw the energy from the lightning so they can power the machine. But before they do, Marty must act as cupid for his parents cause it seems that because they never met they won't fall in love and get married and Marty will not exist.

The filmmaker created his own distinctive visual interpretation of the classic story, bringing the period to life in a way that has never been seen before, in a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role.\n\n\u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d follows would-be writer Nick Carraway as he leaves the Midwest and comes to New York City in the spring of 1922, an era of loosening morals, glittering jazz, bootleg kings, and sky-rocketing stocks.  Chasing his own American Dream, Nick lands next door to a mysterious, party-giving millionaire, Jay Gatsby, and across the bay from his cousin, Daisy, and her philandering, blue-blooded husband, Tom Buchanan.  It is thus that Nick is drawn into the captivating world of the super rich, their illusions, loves and deceits.  As Nick bears witness, within and without of the world he inhabits, he pens a tale of impossible love, incorruptible dreams and high-octane tragedy, and holds a mirror to our own modern times and struggles.",

  "description": "Gregory Peck won an Oscar for his brilliant performance as the Southern lawyer who defends a black man accused of rape in this film version of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. The way in which it captures a time, a place, and above all, a mood, makes this film a masterpiece. The setting is a dusty Southern town during the Depression. A white woman accuses a black man of rape. Though he is obviously innocent, the outcome of his trial is such a foregone conclusion that no lawyer will step forward to defend him - except Peck, the town's most distinguished citizen. His compassionate defense costs him many friendships but earns him the respect and admiration of his two motherless children.",

  "plot_outline": "Oscar® winner Russell Crowe stars as the legendary figure known by generations as \u201cRobin Hood,\u201d whose exploits have endured in popular mythology and ignited the imagination of those who share his spirit of adventure and righteousness.  In 13th century England, Robin and his band of marauders confront corruption in a local village and lead an uprising against the crown that will forever alter the balance of world power.  And whether thief or hero, one man from humble beginnings will become an eternal symbol of freedom for his people.\n\nRobin Hood chronicles the life of an expert archer, previously interested only in self-preservation, from his service in King Richard\u2019s army against the French.  Upon Richard\u2019s death, Robin travels to Nottingham, a town suffering from the corruption of a despotic sheriff and crippling taxation, where he falls for the spirited widow Lady Marion (Oscar® winner Cate Blanchett), a woman skeptical of the identity and motivations of this crusader from the forest.  Hoping to earn the hand of Maid Marion and salvage the village, Robin assembles a gang whose lethal mercenary skills are matched only by its appetite for life.  Together, they begin preying on the indulgent upper class to correct injustices under the sheriff.  \n\nWith their country weakened from decades of war, embattled from the ineffective rule of the new king and vulnerable to insurgencies from within and threats from afar, Robin and his men heed a call to ever greater adventure.  This unlikeliest of heroes and his allies set off to protect their country from slipping into bloody civil war and return glory to England once more.\n\n",

What remains are the ghost of a memory and the terrifying broken lives of his childhood friends ... and an awareness that, somehow, he's responsible in The Butterfly Effect.\n\nThroughout his childhood Evan Treborn (Kutcher) was under the care of a psychologist, who encouraged him to keep a journal. Now in college, Evan reads his journal and finds himself thrust suddenly, inexplicably back in time. Determined to correct the tragic events of his youth, Evan alters the past in hopes of transforming the present.

Ned may be utterly lacking in common sense, but he is their brother and so, after his girlfriend dumps him and boots him off the farm, his sisters once again come to his rescue.  As Liz, Miranda and Natalie each take a turn at housing Ned, their brother's unfailing commitment to honesty creates more than a few messes in their comfortable routines.

  "description": "(May 1, 2012, Los Angeles, CA) \u2013 Confirming widely circulated rumors, Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters and Nirvana announced today that he will direct and produce a feature Documentary film, SOUND CITY about the infamous recording studio in Van Nuys, California. The film was conceived by Grohl after purchasing the legendary Neve 8028 recording console from Sound City Studios last year. The console, built in 1972, is considered by many to be the crown jewel of analog recording equipment, having recorded such artists as Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, Cheap Trick, Guns and Roses, Fear, Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine, Slipknot, Nine Inch Nails, Metallica, and countless other musical legends over the past 40 years.  \n\nThrough interviews with the artists and producers that created decades of musical history at Sound City, the film will showcase the amazing history of the studio, focus on the albums recorded there that went on to change the world, discuss the human element of music in an age of technology, and feature performances from many of the artists that called it \"home\".\n\nGrohl's personal connection to Sound City began with the 1991 recording of Nirvana's breakthrough album, \"Nevermind\". Selling over 30 million copies worldwide, \u201cNevermind\u201d changed the entire musical landscape and forever altered the course of Dave Grohl's life.\n\nRoswell Films, a division of the Roswell Records label that releases Foo Fighters music, will distribute the film. Key personnel involved with the film include Producer/Director Dave Grohl; Editor Paul Crowder (Dogtown & Z Boys, Once In a Lifetime, Riding Giants); and Writer Mark Monroe (The Cove, Once In a Lifetime, The Tillman Story). The film is also being produced in conjunction with Jim Rota, John Ramsay, and Therapy studios.\n\nTHE VIEWS OR OPINIONS EXPRESSED IN THIS DOCUMENTARY AND THE CONTEXT IN WHICH FILM FOOTAGE AND IMAGES ARE USED, DO NOT REFLECT THE VIEWS OR POLICY OF, NOR IMPLY APPROVAL, ENDORSEMENT OR ANY AFFILIATION WITH SOUND CITY,  INC.

Caine invited Nirvan to play his arcade, and Nirvan bought a $2 \"FunPass\" to get 500 turns, and became Caine's first customer. Nirvan was so inspired by Caine's creativity, that he decided to make a film about Caine's Arcade.

  "plot_outline": "Bound by Honor\n\nA gangland feature set in the Chicano culture of East Los Angeles, which traces the lives of three cousins who were raised as brothers and the separate paths they are forced to follow. One searches for the truth in law, one expresses his passion through art, and one finds power in prison. Through it all, family and honour keep their lives intertwined as each strives to find his own personal truth.\n\nBased on the true life experiences of poet Jimmy Santiago Baca, the film focuses on half-brothers Paco and Cruz, and their bi-racial cousin Miklo. It opens in 1972, as the three are members of an East L.A. gang known as the \"Vatos Locos\", and the story focuses on how a violent crime and the influence of narcotics alter their lives. Miklo is incarcerated and sent to San Quentin, where he makes a \"home\" for himself. Cruz becomes an exceptional artist, but a heroin addiction overcomes him with tragic results. Paco becomes a cop and an enemy to his \"carnal\", Miklo.\n\nQuotes:\nCruz: For 10 years, I've been star-trekking through the Twilight Zone.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCruz: You think you used your brotherhood up like a shot of tequila?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMiklo : When you expect nothing and get everything, that's destiny.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPrison Librarian: Cocaine is America's cup of coffee.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMontana: You speak Spanish, so do parrots.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPopeye: Hey, Cinderella, go find yourself a fella, you're on the clock bitch and midnight is coming, you got the wrong man.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMiklo: I may be white from the outside, but I'm brown on the inside, TO THE BONE.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMontana: What do you want?\nMiklo: I thought you wanted it.\nMontana: What?\nMiklo: My chop.\nMontana: I don't want his pork chop.\n[grabs apple from Milko's tray]\nMontana: I want his life.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaco: You wanna dance?

  "plot_outline": "Acclaimed filmmaker Christopher Nolan directs an international cast in \u201cInception,\u201d an original sci-fi actioner that travels around the globe and into the intimate and infinite world of dreams.\n\nDom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a skilled thief, the best in the dangerous art of extraction: stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state when the mind is at its most vulnerable.  Cobb\u2019s rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved.  Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption.  One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible\u2014inception.  Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse; their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one.  If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime.\n\nBut no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move.  An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.  \n\nThis summer, your mind is the scene of the crime.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with Legendary Pictures, a Syncopy Production, a film by Christopher Nolan, \u201cInception.\u201d\n\nThe film stars three-time Academy Award® nominee Leonardo DiCaprio (\u201cBlood Diamond,\u201d \u201cThe Aviator\u201d), Academy Award® nominee Ken Watanabe (\u201cThe Last Samurai\u201d), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (\u201c500 Days of Summer\u201d), Oscar® winner Marion Cotillard (\u201cLa Vie en Rose\u201d), Academy Award® nominee Ellen Page (\u201cJuno\u201d), Tom Hardy (\u201cRocknRolla,\u201d \u201cBronson\u201d), Cillian Murphy (\u201cBatman Begins\u201d), Tom Berenger (\u201cTraining Day\u201d), Dileep Rao (\u201cAvatar\u201d), and two-time Oscar® winner Michael Caine (\u201cHannah and Her Sisters,\u201d \u201cThe Cider House Rules\u201d).\n\n\u201cInception\u201d was written and directed by Oscar® nominee Christopher Nolan (\u201cMemento,\u201d \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d), who also produced the film with Emma Thomas.  Chris Brigham and Thomas Tull served as executive producers, with Jordan Goldberg co-producing.\n\nNolan\u2019s behind-the-scenes collaborators included three-time Oscar®-nominated director of photography Wally Pfister (\u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d \u201cThe Prestige,\u201d \u201cBatman Begins\u201d), production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas (\u201cIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,\u201d \u201cElizabeth: The Golden Age\u201d), two-time Oscar®-nominated editor Lee Smith (\u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d \u201cMaster and Commander: The Far Side of the World\u201d), Oscar®-nominated costume designer Jeffrey Kurland (\u201cBullets Over Broadway,\u201d \u201cCollateral\u201d), and Oscar®-nominated special effects supervisor Chris Corbould (\u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d).  The music is by Academy Award®-winning composer Hans Zimmer (\u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d \u201cThe Lion King\u201d).\n\nConcurrently with the film\u2019s nationwide theatrical release, \u201cInception: The IMAX Experience\u201d will be released in select IMAX® theatres.  \u201cInception\u201d will be digitally re-mastered into the unparalleled image and sound quality of The IMAX Experience® through proprietary IMAX DMR® technology.  With crystal clear images, laser-aligned digital sound and maximized field of view, IMAX provides the world\u2019s most immersive movie experience. \n\nOpening nationwide on July 16, 2010, \u201cInception\u201d has been rated PG-13 by the MPAA for sequences of violence and action throughout.\n\n",

  "description": "Stupid is as stupid does, says Forrest Gump (played by Tom Hanks in an Oscar-winning performance) as he discusses his relative level of intelligence with a stranger while waiting for a bus. Despite his sub-normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest amidst a remarkable array of historical events and people. \n",

When Robert and Nancy marry and move in together, Brennan and Dale are forced to live with each other as step brothers.  As their narcissism and downright aggressive laziness threaten to tear the family apart, these two middle-aged, immature, overgrown boys will orchestrate an insane, elaborate plan to bring their parents back together.  To pull it off, they must form an unlikely bond that maybe, just maybe, will finally get them out of the house.

Lazy stoner Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) has only one reason to visit his equally lazy dealer Saul Silver (James Franco): to purchase weed, specifically, a rare new strain called Pineapple Express.  But when Dale becomes the only witness to a murder by a crooked cop (Rosie Perez) and the city's most dangerous drug lord (Gary Cole), he panics and dumps his roach of Pineapple Express at the scene.  Dale now has another reason to visit Saul: to find out if the weed is so rare that it can be traced back to him.  And it is.  As Dale and Saul run for their lives, they quickly discover that they\u2019re not suffering from weed-fueled paranoia; incredibly, the bad guys really are hot on their trail and trying to figure out the fastest way to kill them both.  All aboard the Pineapple Express. \n\nThe film is directed by David Gordon Green (All the Real Girls).

When the Crown Prince of Austria is found dead, the evidence, as construed by Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan), points to suicide. But Sherlock Holmes deduces that the prince has been the victim of murder\u2014a murder that is only one piece of a larger and much more portentous puzzle, designed by one Professor Moriarty. Mixing business with pleasure, Holmes tracks the clues to an underground gentlemen\u2019s club, where he and his brother, Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry) are toasting Dr. Watson (Jude Law) on his last night of bachelorhood.

Holmes barely manages to save her life and, in return, she reluctantly agrees to help him. The investigation becomes ever more dangerous as it leads Holmes, Watson and Sim across the continent, from England to France to Germany and finally to Switzerland.

Reuniting for their most high-stakes adventure yet, fan favorites Jordana Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Chris \u201cLudacris\u201d Bridges and Elsa Pataky are joined by badass series newcomers Luke Evans and Gina Carano.\n\nSince Dom (Diesel) and Brian\u2019s (Walker) Rio heist toppled a kingpin\u2019s empire and left their crew with $100 million, our heroes have scattered across the globe.  But their inability to return home and living forever on the lam have left their lives incomplete.  \n\nMeanwhile, Hobbs (Johnson) has been tracking an organization of lethally skilled mercenary drivers across 12 countries, whose mastermind (Evans) is aided by a ruthless second-in-command revealed to be the love Dom thought was dead, Letty (Rodriguez).  The only way to stop the criminal outfit is to outmatch them at street level, so Hobbs asks Dom to assemble his elite team in London.  Payment?  Full pardons for all of them so they can return home and make their families whole again.  \n\nBuilding on the worldwide blockbuster success of Fast Five and taking the action, stunts and narrative to even greater heights, Fast & Furious 6 sees director Justin Lin back behind the camera for the fourth time.  He is supported by longtime producers Neal H. Moritz and Vin Diesel, who welcome producer Clayton Townsend back to the series.",

Directed by popular choreographer/actor Prabhu Dheva WANTED was his first directorial venture in Hindi. It had chart bursting music by duo Sajid-Wajid. Filmed on the exotic locations of Greece, Bangkok, Chennai, Hyderabad, Panvel & Mumbai, the film stars Salman Khan in one of the most dynamic roles of his career. He is paired opposite Ayesha Takia for the first time. Others in the cast include Vinod Khanna, Mahesh Manjrekar, Mehak and Southern star Prakash Raj. The movie had to face many obstacles ever since it released. As producer Boney Kapoor said in one of his interviews \"WANTED had to face many obstacles. First of all it was released during the EID period which is not categorically right time to rel a movie (as 40% movie watchin audiences dont go for movies).Even though the movie got the advantage of EID holiday later.It was followed by navrathri celbrations which again took people away from theatres.plus thr was a major opposition from another movie in the form of Dil Bolle Hadippa produced by Indias No1 production house yashraj films.Also the movie was unfortunatley given an A certificate by the censor board which kept the family audience away\".Inspite of all these oppositions WANTED became the biggest hit of 2009 breaking box office records in almost 300 centres.WANTED has also become one of the top ten all time revenue earners.",

Winning means that they must turn around and leave their family and close friends, embarking on a \"Victor's Tour\" of the districts. Along the way Katniss senses that a rebellion is simmering, but the Capitol is still very much in control as President Snow prepares the 75th Annual Hunger Games (The Quarter Quell) - a competition that could change Panem forever. \n\nTHE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE is directed by Francis Lawrence, from a screenplay by Simon Beaufoy and Michael DeBruyn, based upon the novel \u201cCatching Fire\u201d by Suzanne Collins and produced by Nina Jacobson and Jon Kilik. The novel is the second in a trilogy that has over 50 million copies in print in the U.S. alone. THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE opens on November 22, 2013. Lionsgate presents a Color Force/Lionsgate production.",

An instant classic and an unparalleled box office success, the rousing \"space opera\" was equal parts fairy tale, western, 1930s serial and special effects extravaganza, with roots in mythologies from cultures around the world. \n\nFrom the mind of visionary writer/director George Lucas, the epic space fantasy introduced the mystical Force into the cultural vocabulary and it continues to grow, its lush universe ever-expanding through film, television, publishing, video games and more.\n\nMay the Force Be With You...

With the whole nation watching, he is just one question away from winning a staggering 20 million rupees on India's \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" But when the show breaks for the night, police arrest him on suspicion of cheating; how could a street kid know so much? Desperate to prove his innocence, Jamal tells the story of his life in the slum where he and his brother grew up, of their adventures together on the road, of vicious encounters with local gangs, and of Latika (Pinto), the girl he loved and lost. Each chapter of Jamal's increasingly layered story reveals where he learned the answers to the show's seemingly impossible questions. But one question remains a mystery: what is this young man with no apparent desire for riches really doing on the game show? When the new day dawns and Jamal returns to answer the final question, the Inspector and sixty million viewers are about to find out. At the heart of its exuberant storytelling lies the intriguing question of how anyone comes to know the things they know about life and love.",
